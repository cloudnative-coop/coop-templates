* cloud native cooperation

ii at it's heart is about creating space for people to help each other, and
attempt to capture the output of that as Co-Authored-By everyone participating.

ii also means instant infrastructure. What we author together requires tooling,
and that tooling can vary from project to project. Many times this is
documented, but having that infrastructure brought up 'instantly' is also core
to the way we work.

cloud native means more than kubernetes, and the spaces we need tooling and
infrastructure on alternate operating systems.

Longer term, cloud native is also more than using hosted cloud providers, but
also being able to bring the "cloud down to earth". Something folks can download
USB sticks to bring up cloud native environments before the understand how to
even read the documentation.
