## Another way 
If you just want to play the game you can navigate to the desktop menu and search Minecraft 

It might take a while to load and look like not much is happening but it is! to see what programs are running open the kitty terminal 

in the command line, type `htop` to start the htop program and see what the system is doing under the hood.



## Starting the mouse-control script. 
- To be able to play minecraft smoothly we need to use a script which converts key presses into mouse track movement

- Open the kitty terminal

`cd mouse-controls`

Then:

`python mouse-controls.py`

- The current keybindings are: 

`Up Left Right Down` arrow keys to pan the camera
`w` - move forward 
`a` - move left
`s` - move down
`d` - move right 
`Enter` - mine the blocks 
`f` - places blocks 

if the camera starts spinning uncontrollably return to the terminal and makesure there is no errors that have been returned by the script, if there is, just re-run the script by following the above commands. 

#### In minecraft you need to turn off the `raw input`

- press `esc` to bring up the menu then navigate to: options > controls > mouse settings > raw input and switch it to off
